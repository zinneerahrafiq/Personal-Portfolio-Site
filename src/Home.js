    <h1 className='homeh1'> A little about me </h1>
    <p className='homepara'>Hey there! I'm Zinneerah Rafiq, a passionate computer science major with an insatiable love for noodles and anything made of potato. When I'm not busy debugging lines of code, you'll find me fearlessly exploring new noodle recipes like a true foodie on a mission. From ramen to pasta, I believe that a perfectly cooked bowl of noodles can make the world a tastier place.

And let's not forget about potatoes! Whether they're mashed, fried, or roasted, I know how to transform the humble spud into a gastronomic masterpiece.

But my zest for life doesn't stop there. I thrive on engaging in captivating discussions about productivity, inspiration, and all things YouTube. Speaking of YouTube, I absolutely adore watching videos of girls from abroad who are in college. Their productive routines and inspiring journeys never fail to ignite my motivation.
